			description: ["With your new &bDeployer&r, you can create a &lsimple tree farm&r - simply rebuild your wheat farm but replace the &bHarvesters&r with &bMechanical Saws&r (mind the orientation and the rotation direction).

However it is not that simple, as &bMechanical Saws&r can only cut trees and &lnot plant them&r, that's where the &bDeployer&r comes into play - place them 2 blocks above the ground level facing downwards, set their filter to be a sapling of your choosing and add a &bChest&r or other container on the contraption - this is where the deployers will take the saplings from. Keep in mind the tree farm produces &lother byproducts&r as well, mainly &bSticks and Saplings&r - shouldn't be a problem when utilizing the &lfiltering methods from the previous chapter&r"]
